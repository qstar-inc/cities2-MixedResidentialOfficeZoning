# Mixed Residential Office Zoning

This mod adds copy of the Mixed Residential buildings, with a twist. Instead of having commercial space at the bottom, this one has office spaces.

## Usage
* Zone and Wait
* Or plop "MixedOffice" using Find It or Dev Menu

## DISCLAIMER
> This mod requires [Asset Packs Manager](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/78903/Windows) which is highly experimental.
This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors.
Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save.
But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage.
Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.

## Came from the in-game notification?
> This mod was previously called "VP EU Commercial High" but as of May 12, 2024 this mod is now "Mixed Residential Office Zoning".
